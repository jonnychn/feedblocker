// Background script for the Feed Blocker extension

// This script currently does not include active logic but is needed to fulfill the manifest's background service worker requirement.
// Future enhancements can include user-specific preferences or logging feed activity here.

console.log("Feed Blocker background script initialized.");

// Add logic to include reddit.com and x.com in feed blocking
// This would require updating content scripts to handle their specific feed structures.
